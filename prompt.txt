can you look refer the ui of @lib/screens/home_screen.dart  @lib/screens/plant_details_screen.dart and @lib/screens/plant_detail_screen.dart  page. analyse the colors, use of images as background in some places fonts, color of buttons etc, types of icons ,size of various widgets, padding etc. and fix the ux of @lib/screens/add_plant_screen.dart. basically i want all the screens to follow consistent styling. i have added few more images in assets folder . keep the size of boxes, text and all other widgets optimal, such that it perfectly fits into the screen whitthout requiring scrolling in most cases.
