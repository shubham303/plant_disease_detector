## 🔍 Disease Identification

### **Primary Disease: Early Blight**
- **Scientific Name**: *Alternaria solani*
- **Severity Level**: Moderate (Stage 2/4)
- **Confidence**: 87%

### **Secondary Concerns**: 
- Minor nutrient deficiency (Nitrogen)
- Slight water stress indicators

## 📝 Disease Description

**Early Blight** is one of the most common fungal diseases affecting tomato plants. It typically appears as:

- Dark brown to black spots with concentric rings (target-like appearance)
- Yellowing of leaves around the spots
- Leaf drop starting from lower branches
- Can affect stems and fruits in advanced stages

This disease thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly through water splash, wind, and contaminated tools.

## 🚨 Immediate Actions Required

### **Critical (Do Today)**
1. **Remove affected leaves** - Cut and dispose of all infected foliage
2. **Improve air circulation** - Prune lower branches and space plants properly
3. **Stop overhead watering** - Water at soil level only

### **This Week**
4. **Apply fungicide** - Use copper-based fungicide or neem oil
5. **Mulch around plants** - Prevent soil splash onto leaves
6. **Check neighboring plants** - Inspect for early signs of infection

## 💊 Treatment Plan

### **Organic Treatment Options**
- **Baking Soda Spray**: 1 tsp per quart water + few drops dish soap
- **Neem Oil**: Apply every 7-14 days in evening
- **Copper Fungicide**: Follow package instructions carefully

### **Chemical Treatment** (if organic fails)
- **Chlorothalonil** or **Mancozeb** based fungicides
- Rotate between different active ingredients to prevent resistance

## 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

### **Cultural Practices**
- **Crop Rotation**: Don't plant tomatoes in same spot for 3-4 years
- **Proper Spacing**: Ensure good air circulation between plants
- **Drip Irrigation**: Avoid getting leaves wet
- **Clean Garden Tools**: Disinfect between plants

### **Environmental Controls**
- **Morning Watering**: Allows leaves to dry quickly
- **Mulching**: Prevents soil-borne spores from splashing up
- **Stake/Cage Plants**: Keep fruits and leaves off ground
